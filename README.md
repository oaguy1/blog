# Blog

A repo for all my blogging. Uses a Common Lisp library I built to generate the blog ([cl-yassg](https://github.com/oaguy1/cl-yassg)) and [Spinneret](https://github.com/ruricolist/spinneret) for templating.

Use `build.sh` to build the site. It uses `build.lisp` under the hood as a crude script to generate the site. Outputs to `../blog-ouput` which points to my GitHub Pages page [here](http://oaguy1.github.io).
